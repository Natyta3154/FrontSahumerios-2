    content: '<p>Aromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts to promote health and well-being. Sometimes called essential oil therapy, aromatherapy uses aromatic essential oils medicinally to improve the health of the body, mind, and spirit. It enhances both physical and emotional health.</p><p>Aromatherapy is thought of as both an art and a science. Recently, aromatherapy has gained more recognition in the fields of science and medicine.</p><h3>How does aromatherapy work?</h3><p>Researchers believe that inhaling essential oil molecules, or absorbing essential oils through the skin, transmits messages to the limbic system â€” a brain region responsible for controlling emotions and influencing the nervous system. These messages can affect biological factors such as heart rate, stress levels, blood pressure, breathing, and immune function.</p>'
